# R package betalink

Measures of network dissimiliraty using R. 

Note the version in this branch is older that the original 'betalink' repository and should be depreciated.

If you are looking for a quantitative version for calculating betadiversity, and a second decomposition of betadiversity in richness and turnover components. Those are on the branch ['new_features'](https://github.com/ibartomeus/betalink/tree/new_features).
